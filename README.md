# Python3000-Missions
Practical, Professional Projects for Python 3

## Welcome!

The Missions defined herein are designed to help prepare you for work in the real-world. 

By building upon your mastery of the Python programming language, this project defines applications using common design artifacts and requirement documentation. -The type of mission requiremnts one might exepct to see from a software architect, designer, stakeholder, or client. 

If you are looking to create a Request For Proposal (**RFP**,) or an Invitation To Negotiate (**ITN**,) then you might also find these Missions instructive.

Like our [Python by Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J), the solution for each Mission hereunder will be available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Randall-Nagy/e/B08ZJLH1VN).

*p.s.*  If you are looking for some free & open professionally-described practice activities for beginners, then you might also enjoy [Python1000-Practice-Activities](https://github.com/soft9000/Python1000-Practice-Activities).
